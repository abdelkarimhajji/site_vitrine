             <p>French is considered by many to be the language 
                 of love and romance. However, it is not only
                  limited to love. The French language is so 
                  widespread that the number of French speakers 
                  around the world is estimated at 300 million, and
                   thus it ranks ninth among the most spoken languages
                    in the world, and first, along with English, in terms 
                    of pronunciation in the five continents.</p>

                    As soon as you join the French language course,
                    you will begin your educational journey through
                    which I will review with you the foundations and 
                    principles of the French language. The method used
                    aims to give the learner autonomy and autonomy - ie
                    push the learner to form sentences and communicate. 
                    Therefore, I ask all of you to write the lessons and 
                    information on a notebook or brochure and review it 
                    periodically until you can complete the lessons, so 
                    learning any language needs repetition and practice.
